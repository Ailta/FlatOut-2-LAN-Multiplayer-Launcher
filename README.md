# HOWTO FILE CONTENTS

--Installation--
So how do you launch the game?
When u download the launcher, just unzip it, then create settings.txt file in the same location as u have the launcher in. Then locate your game and by right clicking u can create a file shortcut. Put the shortcut into the same location as the launcher and rename it to something like, "flatout2" or "idk" or "doesntmatter", then put the same name into the settings.txt and put a ".lnk" behind the name, something like this: "example.lnk". Then u can start the launcher and done.

Or

You can just put the launcher into the same directory as your game is in, and then you can launch it, it will create the settings.txt for u and in case the game doesn't open, just find the .exe of your game and put the .exe files name into the settings, something like this: "FlatOut2.exe".



--How to use--
When u launch the launcher, you'll see four options, two are currently not done, so they're grayed out. The two options that u want, are "run client" & "run server".
-Connect to server-
If u want to connect to a server, you can just select "run client", it will search for the servers for u. After a few seconds, you will see IP addresses of server/s, you can just select to which one u want to join and done. If none show up, you can try to select the "Custom IP" option, you will need the servers IP for that tho. If even that won't work, then you're either not on the same network as the server is (you could try to tell the server guy to try to run the server on different network/ip), thus you can't connect to it, or you might have either very bad connection to each other, or, and I haven't tested this, you have somehow after all these years that this game is out for, different versions of the game.
-Create a server-
If u want to create a server, you can just select "run server", then choose the network/ip you want the server to run on and done.
